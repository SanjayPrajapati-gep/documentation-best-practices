# Documentation Best Practices

## What This Is

This is a repository that collects documentation good practices with examples and bad practices as counter-examples in order to create a repeatible process of creating easy-to-understand documentation.

Although this repository is created with software documentation in mind, I believe the practices are applicable to all technological areas.

## Who This Is For

This repository is primarily targeted to software developers who are usually not considered as a documentation writer. However, as I said above, I believe all the developers or engineers who work in the technological areas can be beneficial from it.
