A currently common documentation pattern is:

## Bad Examples

### Reference without Definition

See the section ["Control Machine Requirements"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) of Ansible's documentation. This section is the first time the term "control machine" is used, but there is no definition or explanation of what a "control machine" is. The reader needs to infer it from the context.

This looks quite like in a program you start to use a variable without defining it. "Hey," you may argue, "the compiler should be smart enough to figure out what that variable means from its context. Any compiler that's unable to do so is dumb."
